# tei2hocr.xsl

XSLT 2.0 stylesheet to convert TEI OCR data to HOCR.

Currently only tested with the OCR data from the Deutsches Textarchiv,
but it should in principle work with any TEI document that has coordinates
at the character level.

Requires an XSLT 2.0 capable processor, Saxon HE is recommended.
